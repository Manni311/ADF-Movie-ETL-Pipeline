This is a **cost-free simulated Azure Data Factory (ADF) project** designed to showcase ETL skills for freelancing portfolios and job interviews.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates an ETL pipeline that:
- Ingests movie data from a CSV file stored in Azure Blob Storage (simulated)
- Transforms the data (conceptual)
- Loads it into an Azure SQL database (simulated)

This repository does not include actual pipeline runs, helping avoid Azure charges, but clearly demonstrates your understanding of ADF.
