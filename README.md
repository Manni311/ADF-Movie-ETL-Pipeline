## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a pipeline that:
- Ingests a movie CSV file from blob storage
- Transforms the data (conceptually)
- Loads into an Azure SQL database

Although this project doesn't run in Azure (to avoid charges), it demonstrates your understanding of ADF concepts and structure.
